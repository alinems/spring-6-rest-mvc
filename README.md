# Spring Framework 6: Beginner to Guru
## Spring 6 Rest MVC

Repository forked from springframeworkguru/spring-6-rest-mvc to follow the course https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-6-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/33575750#overview

For learning purposes the commited code should match the original repo, otherwise checking progression during the course would be impossible (i. e., git diff is used at the end of each lesson and I do not like to accumulate differences!)
